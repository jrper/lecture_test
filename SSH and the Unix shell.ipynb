    "- \"A shell is a program whose primary purpose is to read commands and run other programs.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "At a high level, computers do four things:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   run programs\n",
    "-   store data\n",
    "-   communicate with each other, and\n",
    "-   interact with us\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "They can do the last of these in many different ways,\n",
    "including through a keyboard and mouse, touch screen interfaces, or using speech recognition systems.\n",
    "While touch and voice interfaces are becoming more commonplace, most interaction is still\n",
    "done using traditional screens, mice, touchpads and keyboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **graphical user interface** (GUI) is the most widely used way to interact with\n",
    "personal computers. We give instructions (to run a program, to copy a file, to create\n",
    "a new folder/directory) with the convenience of a few mouse clicks. This way of interacting\n",
    "with a computer is intuitive and very easy to learn. But this way of giving instructions to\n",
    "a computer scales very poorly if we are to give a large stream of instructions even if they\n",
    "are similar or identical. For example if we have to copy the third line of each of a thousand\n",
    "text files stored in thousand different directories and paste it into a single file\n",
    "line by line. Using the traditional GUI approach of clicks will take several hours to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where we take advange of the shell - a **command-line interface**\n",
    "to make such repetitive tasks automatic and fast. It can take a single instruction and\n",
    "repeat it as is or with some modification as many times as we want. The task in\n",
    "the example above can be accomplished in a few minutes at most.\n",
    "\n",
    "The heart of a command-line interface is a **read-evaluate-print loop** (REPL). It is called\n",
    "so because when you type a command and press <kbd>Return</kbd> (also known as <kbd>Enter</kbd>) the shell\n",
    "reads your command,\n",
    "evaluates (or \"executes\") it,\n",
    "prints the output of your command,\n",
    "loops back and waits for you to enter another command.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Shell is a program which runs other programs rather than doing calculations itself.\n",
    "Those programs can be as complicated as climate modeling software and as simple as a\n",
    "program that creates a new directory. The simple programs which are used to perform\n",
    "stand alone tasks are usually refered to as commands.\n",
    "The most popular Unix shell is Bash, (the Bourne Again SHell --- so-called because\n",
    "it's derived from a shell written by Stephen Bourne).\n",
    "Bash is the default shell on most modern implementations of Unix\n",
    "and in most packages that provide Unix-like tools for Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When the shell is first opened, you are presented with a **prompt**,\n",
    "indicating that the shell is waiting for input.\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~bash\n",
    "$\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "The shell typically uses `$ ` as the prompt, but may use a different symbol.\n",
    "In the examples for this lesson, we'll show the prompt as `$ `.\n",
    "Most importantly:\n",
    "when typing commands, either from these lessons or from other sources,\n",
    "*do not type the prompt*, only the commands that follow it. We are running inside the Jupyter bash kernel, so will usually suppress it ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's try our first command, which will list the contents of the current directory:"

    "### Is it difficult?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a different model of interacting than a GUI, and that\n",
    "will take some effort - and some time - to learn. A GUI\n",
    "presents you with choices and you select one. With a **command line interface** (CLI) the choices are combinations\n",
    "of commands and parameters, more like words in a language than buttons on a screen. They\n",
    "are not presented to you so\n",
    "you must learn a few, like learning some vocabulary in a new language. But a small\n",
    "number of commands gets you a long way, and we'll cover those essential few today.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flexibility and automation\n",
    "\n",
    "The grammar of a shell allows you to combine existing tools into powerful\n",
    "pipelines and handle large volumes of data automatically. Sequences of\n",
    "commands can be written into a *script*, improving the reproducibility of\n",
    "workflows and allowing you to repeat them easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the command line is often the easiest way to interact with remote machines and supercomputers.\n",
    "Familiarity with the shell is near essential to run a variety of specialized tools and resources\n",
    "including high-performance computing systems.\n",
    "As clusters and cloud computing systems become more popular for scientific data crunching,\n",
    "being able to interact with the shell is becoming a necessary skill.\n",
    "We can build on the command-line skills covered here\n",
    "to tackle a wide range of scientific questions and computational challenges.\n",

    "## Nelle's Pipeline: A Typical Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Nelle Nemo, a marine biologist,\n",
    "has just returned from a six-month survey of the\n",
    "[North Pacific Gyre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pacific_Gyre),\n",
    "where she has been sampling gelatinous marine life in the\n",
    "[Great Pacific Garbage Patch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch).\n",
    "She has 1520 samples in all and now needs to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Run each sample through an assay machine\n",
    "    that will measure the relative abundance of 300 different proteins.\n",
    "    The machine's output for a single sample is\n",
    "    a file with one line for each protein.\n",
    "2.  Calculate statistics for each of the proteins separately\n",
    "    using a program her supervisor wrote called `goostats`.\n",
    "3.  Write up results.\n",
    "    Her supervisor would really like her to do this by the end of the month\n",
    "    so that her paper can appear in an upcoming special issue of *Aquatic Goo Letters*.\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes her about two weeks to run her samples by the assay machine.\n",
    "Now she has the daunting task of analysing her results by running 'goostats'.\n",
    "The bad news is that if she has to run `goostats` by hand using a GUI,\n",
    "she'll have to select a file using an open file dialog 1520 times.\n",
    "At 30 seconds per sample,\n",
    "the whole process will take more than 12 hours\n",
    "(and that's assuming the best-case scenario where she is ready to select the next file\n",
    "as soon as the previous sample analysis has finished).\n",
    "This zero-breaks always-ready scenario is only achievable by a machine so it would\n",
    "likely take much longer than 12 hours, not to mention that\n",
    "the chances of her selecting all of those files correctly are practically zero.\n",
    "Missing that paper deadline is looking increasingly likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next few lessons will explore what she should do instead.\n",
    "More specifically,\n",
    "they explain how she can use a command shell to run the `goostats` program,\n",
    "using loops to automate the repetitive steps e.g. entering file names,\n",
    "so that her computer can work 24 hours a day while she writes her paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a bonus,\n",
    "once she has put a processing pipeline together,\n",
    "she will be able to use it again whenever she collects more data.\n",

    "## Navigating Files and Directories\n",
    "\n",
    "The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories\n",

    "Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories.\n",
    "To start exploring them, we'll go to our open shell window.\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's find out where we are by running a command called `pwd`\n",
    "(which stands for \"print working directory\"). Directories are like *places* - at any time\n",
    "while we are using the shell we are in exactly one place, called\n",
    "our **current working directory**. Commands mostly read and write files in the\n",
    "current working directory, i.e. \"here\", so knowing where you are before running\n",
    "a command is important. `pwd` shows you where you are:\n",
    "\n",

    "~~~bash\n",
    "/Users/nelle\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "Here,\n",
    "the computer's response is `/Users/nelle`,\n",
    "which is Nelle's **home directory**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ## Home Directory Variation\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The home directory path will look different on different operating systems.\n",
    "> On Linux it may look like `/home/nelle`,\n",
    "> and on Windows it will be similar to `C:\\Documents and Settings\\nelle` or\n",
    "> `C:\\Users\\nelle`.\n",
    "> (Note that it may look slightly different for different versions of Windows.)\n",
    "> In future examples, we've used Mac output as the default - Linux and Windows\n",
    "> output may differ slightly, but should be generally similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what a \"home directory\" is,\n",
    "let's have a look at how the file system as a whole is organized.  For the\n",
    "sake of this example, we'll be\n",

    "this is the leading slash in `/Users/nelle`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside that directory are several other directories:\n",
    "`bin` (which is where some built-in programs are stored),\n",
    "`data` (for miscellaneous data files),\n",
    "`Users` (where users' personal directories are located),\n",
    "`tmp` (for temporary files that don't need to be stored long-term),\n",
    "and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that our current working directory `/Users/nelle` is stored inside `/Users`\n",
    "because `/Users` is the first part of its name.\n",
    "Similarly,\n",
    "we know that `/Users` is stored inside the root directory `/`\n",
    "because its name begins with `/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ## Slashes\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Notice that there are two meanings for the `/` character.\n",
    "> When it appears at the front of a file or directory name,\n",

    "> path: `here/there/~/elsewhere` is *not* `here/there/Users/nelle/elsewhere`.\n",
